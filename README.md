# GRIT - Growth through Rigorous Iterative Training

**Complete Data Science Learning Path: Zero to Job-Ready**

A comprehensive, project-based curriculum covering Python, SQL, data analysis, and machine learning. Built for self-learners who want practical skills and a strong portfolio.

## What This Is

GRIT is a structured learning path that takes you from zero coding experience to job-ready data scientist. Each module builds on the previous one, with hands-on projects and real-world applications.

**Core Principles:**
- Project-based learning (build your portfolio as you learn)
- Incremental progression (master fundamentals before advancing)
- Industry-focused skills (learn what employers actually need)
- Open source and completely free

## Repository Structure

### 01-Python-Fundamentals
Master Python basics through 10 progressive notebooks. Covers variables, data structures, control flow, functions, and file handling. Each notebook includes exercises and debug challenges.

**Projects:** Calculator app, text parser, data cleaner

### 02-SQL-Mastery
Learn SQL from basics to advanced queries. Includes practical database design, joins, aggregations, and query optimization using real e-commerce data.

**Projects:** Business analytics dashboard, customer segmentation analysis

### 03-Data-Libraries
Deep dive into the Python data science stack:
- **NumPy:** Array operations, vectorization, linear algebra
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation, cleaning, transformation
- **Matplotlib:** Publication-quality static visualizations
- **Seaborn:** Statistical graphics and analysis
- **Plotly:** Interactive dashboards and web visualizations

**Projects:** Customer analytics pipeline, interactive sales dashboard, image processing system

### 04-Data-Science-Foundations
Mathematical foundations for data science:
- Mathematics for data science
- Statistics and probability
- Data preprocessing techniques
- Exploratory data analysis framework
- End-to-end ML pipeline

**Projects:** Statistical analysis toolkit, data preprocessing pipeline

### 05-Kaggle-Notebooks
Curated collection of 29 high-impact Kaggle notebooks covering:
- Exploratory data analysis techniques
- Feature engineering strategies
- Machine learning model development
- Deep learning applications
- NLP and text analysis
- Data visualization best practices
- Competition strategies

Each notebook is selected for teaching value and real-world applicability. Includes beginner to advanced content across multiple domains.

## Learning Path

**Phase 1: Foundations (2 months)**
1. Python Fundamentals (10 days)
2. SQL Mastery (7 days)
3. Data Libraries (5 weeks)

**Phase 2: Core Skills (1 month)**
1. Data Science Foundations (2 weeks)
2. Kaggle Notebooks Study (2 weeks)

**Phase 3: Advanced Topics (3+ months)**
- Machine learning algorithms
