    "**Learning Objectives**\n",
    "- Master subqueries in WHERE, FROM, and SELECT clauses\n",
    "- Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for readability\n",
    "- Understand correlated vs non-correlated subqueries\n",
    "- Apply recursive CTEs for hierarchical data\n",
    "- Write complex business queries with nested logic\n",
    "- Optimize query performance with advanced techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters**  \n",
    "Simple queries can only answer basic questions. Subqueries and CTEs let you ask sophisticated questions like \"Find customers who spent more than the average customer\" or \"Show products that outsold their category average.\" This is where SQL becomes a powerful analytical tool!\n",
    "\n",

    "### What Are Subqueries?\n",
    "A subquery is a query nested inside another query. Like a Russian doll of SQL!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Subqueries:**\n",
    "- **Scalar**: Returns single value (used in SELECT/WHERE)\n",
    "- **Single-row**: Returns one row (used in WHERE)\n",
    "- **Multi-row**: Returns multiple rows (used with IN/EXISTS)\n",
    "- **Table**: Returns table (used in FROM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are CTEs?\n",
    "**Common Table Expressions** make complex queries readable:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH cte_name AS (\n",
    "    -- Complex subquery here\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT * FROM cte_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlated vs Non-Correlated:\n",
    "- **Non-correlated**: Independent subquery (runs once)\n",
    "- **Correlated**: References outer query (runs for each row)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Note:\n",
    "CTEs are often more readable but may not always be faster than subqueries."

    "## Takeaways & Further Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subquery Types Mastered:\n",
    "✅ **Scalar Subqueries**: Return single values for comparisons  \n",
    "✅ **IN/NOT IN**: Check membership in result sets  \n",
    "✅ **EXISTS/NOT EXISTS**: Test for existence of related data  \n",
    "✅ **FROM Subqueries**: Create temporary tables for complex analysis  \n",
    "✅ **Correlated Subqueries**: Reference outer query values  \n",
    "\n",
    "### CTE Best Practices:\n",
    "✅ **Readability**: Break complex queries into logical steps  \n",
    "✅ **Reusability**: Use same CTE multiple times in main query  \n",
    "✅ **Debugging**: Easier to test and modify individual components  \n",
    "✅ **Performance**: Often equivalent to subqueries in execution  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Subquery Performance**: Non-correlated run once, correlated run per row\n",
    "- **EXISTS vs IN**: EXISTS often faster for large datasets\n",
    "- **CTEs vs Subqueries**: CTEs usually more readable, same performance\n",
    "- **Window Functions**: Advanced analytics with OVER clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Patterns:\n",
    "- **Above/Below Average**: Compare to aggregate values\n",
    "- **Top Performers**: Find records exceeding thresholds\n",
    "- **Missing Data**: Find records without related data\n",
    "- **Complex Reports**: Multi-step analysis with CTEs\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Best Practices:\n",
    "- Use CTEs for complex queries requiring multiple steps\n",
    "- Prefer EXISTS over IN for existence checks\n",
    "- Test subqueries independently before nesting\n",
    "- Use aliases consistently for readability\n",
    "- Consider performance when choosing subquery vs JOIN\n",
    "\n",
