    "- **Borrowers table**: Name, address, phone\n",
    "- **Loans table**: Book ID, Borrower ID, due date\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Relationships:\n",
    "- **One-to-One**: One customer has one profile\n",
    "- **One-to-Many**: One customer has many orders\n",
    "- **Many-to-Many**: Many products in many orders\n",

    "### Foreign Keys:\n",
    "Foreign keys link tables together:\n",
    "- `orders.customer_id` → `customers.customer_id`\n",

    "- **INNER JOIN**: Only matching rows\n",

    "### JOIN Types Mastered:\n",
    "✅ **INNER JOIN**: Only matching rows from both tables  \n",
    "✅ **LEFT JOIN**: All rows from left table + matching rows from right  \n",
    "✅ **Multiple JOINs**: Combine 3+ tables for complete relationships  \n",
    "✅ **Foreign Keys**: Links that connect table relationships  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Relationships**: One-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many\n",
    "- **NULL handling**: LEFT JOIN + COALESCE for missing data\n",
    "- **Duplicate avoidance**: Use DISTINCT when needed\n",
    "- **Performance**: INNER JOIN is usually faster than LEFT JOIN\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Patterns:\n",
    "- **Customer + Orders**: LEFT JOIN to include customers without orders\n",
    "- **Orders + Items + Products**: INNER JOINs for complete order details\n",
    "- **Sales Analysis**: LEFT JOIN products with sales for performance metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Best Practices:\n",
    "- Use table aliases (c, o, p) for readability\n",
    "- Choose INNER vs LEFT JOIN based on your needs\n",
    "- Use COALESCE() for NULL handling\n",
    "- Be careful with many-to-many relationships\n",
