    "- **TEXT**: Like a suitcase for clothes (words, names, descriptions)\n",

    "### Why Data Types Matter\n",

    "## Takeaways & Further Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types You Learned:\n",
    "✅ **TEXT**: For names, addresses, descriptions  \n",
    "✅ **INTEGER**: For whole numbers (ages, quantities)  \n",
    "✅ **REAL**: For decimal numbers (prices, measurements)  \n",
    "✅ **DATE**: For calendar dates and times  \n",
    "✅ **NULL**: Represents missing or unknown data  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Operators You Mastered:\n",
    "✅ **Comparison**: =, !=, <, >, <=, >=  \n",
    "✅ **Logical**: AND, OR, NOT  \n",
    "✅ **Pattern**: LIKE with wildcards (%)  \n",
    "✅ **Range**: BETWEEN for number/date ranges  \n",
    "✅ **Sets**: IN for multiple value checks  \n",
    "✅ **NULL checks**: IS NULL, IS NOT NULL  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Case sensitivity**: Text comparisons are case-sensitive\n",
    "- **Operator precedence**: AND is evaluated before OR (use parentheses!)\n",
    "- **Wildcards**: % matches any characters, _ matches single character\n",
    "- **NULL behavior**: NULL comparisons need special operators\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Best Practices:\n",
    "- Use parentheses to make complex conditions clear\n",
    "- Test queries with small datasets first\n",
    "- Use meaningful aliases for complex expressions\n",
    "- Comment complex WHERE clauses\n",
    "\n",
