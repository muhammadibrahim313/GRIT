    "## Theory: Understanding Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Aggregation?\n",
    "Aggregation is like summarizing a shopping list:\n",
    "- **Individual items**: Apple, Banana, Apple, Orange, Banana\n",
    "- **Summary**: 2 Apples, 2 Bananas, 1 Orange\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Aggregation Functions:\n",
    "- **COUNT()**: How many items?\n",
    "- **SUM()**: Total of numbers\n",
    "- **AVG()**: Average value\n",
    "- **MIN()**: Smallest value\n",
    "- **MAX()**: Largest value\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use GROUP BY:\n",
    "GROUP BY creates subgroups, like:\n",
    "- \"Show me sales by category\"\n",
    "- \"Count customers by state\"\n",
    "- \"Average price by brand\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### WHERE vs HAVING:\n",
    "- **WHERE**: Filters rows before grouping\n",
    "- **HAVING**: Filters groups after aggregation"

    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Aggregation** turns detailed data into summaries\n",
