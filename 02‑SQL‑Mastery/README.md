## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Learning Format

### **Primary Format: Jupyter Notebooks**
- Interactive learning with immediate feedback
- SQL magic commands (`%sql` and `%%sql`)
- Visual query results and explanations
- Integrated exercises and solutions

### **Supporting Files:**
- `.sql` files: Pure SQL scripts for reference
- `.db` files: SQLite databases for practice
- `.csv` files: Sample data files

## üéØ Learning Approach

- **Query-First**: Learn by writing and running actual SQL queries
- **Data-Centric**: Work with realistic datasets (e-commerce, sales, etc.)
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Start simple, build to complex real-world scenarios
- **Practical Focus**: Every concept includes hands-on exercises
- **Performance Minded**: Learn efficient query patterns from Day 1

## üìñ How to Use These Materials

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter ipython-sql sqlalchemy pandas matplotlib
   ```

2. **Start SQLite**:
   ```python
   %load_ext sql
   %sql sqlite:///sample_data.db
   ```

3. **Follow the Daily Rhythm**:
   - Read theory and examples (15-20 min)
   - Code along with examples (20-30 min)
   - Complete exercises (30-45 min)
   - Debug and optimize queries (15-20 min)

## üìä Sample Database

We use SQLite with a realistic e-commerce dataset including:
- `customers` table: Customer information
- `orders` table: Order details
- `products` table: Product catalog
- `order_items` table: Order line items

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- Understanding of data concepts (from Python Fundamentals)
- SQLite installed (comes with Python)
- No prior SQL experience needed!

## üìû Support & Resources

### **Getting Help:**
- Review the hints in each notebook
- Check the `.sql` reference files
- Use SQLite's error messages as guides
- Break complex queries into smaller steps

### **Additional Resources:**
- [SQLite Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html)
- [SQLZoo Practice](https://sqlzoo.net/) - Interactive SQL learning
- [Mode Analytics SQL Tutorial](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/)

### **Debugging Tips:**
- Use `SELECT *` to explore table structure
- Check column names and data types
- Verify JOIN conditions carefully
- Use `LIMIT` when testing queries
