    "## Takeaways & Further Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Learned Today:\n",
    "✅ **SELECT** - Choose specific columns or all columns (*)  \n",
    "✅ **FROM** - Specify which table to query  \n",
    "✅ **WHERE** - Filter rows based on conditions  \n",
    "✅ **ORDER BY** - Sort results (ASC/DESC)  \n",
    "✅ **LIMIT** - Restrict number of results  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key SQL Concepts:\n",
    "- **Tables** are like spreadsheets with rows and columns\n",
    "- **Columns** contain specific types of data (text, numbers, dates)\n",
    "- **Rows** represent individual records\n",
    "- **Primary Keys** uniquely identify each row\n",
    "- **Foreign Keys** link tables together\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Best Practices:\n",
    "- Use meaningful column names\n",
    "- Be specific with your SELECT (avoid SELECT * in production)\n",
    "- Use comments to explain complex queries\n",
    "- Test your queries with LIMIT first\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tomorrow Preview:\n",
    "Day 2: **Data Types & Operators** - We'll learn about different data types (text, numbers, dates) and powerful filtering operators like BETWEEN, IN, and LIKE!\n",
